# McDonald's Fast Food Dataset Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis related to McDonald's fast-food consumer behavior and segmentation analysis. The primary dataset used for analysis is `mcdonalds.csv`.

## Overview

This case study explores consumer behavior and segmentation analysis based on data collected from McDonald's customers. The data includes various attributes related to consumer preferences, demographics, and visit frequency to McDonald's outlets.

## Dataset Information

- **File:** `mcdonalds.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset contains information about McDonald's consumers, including columns like 'Age', 'Gender', 'VisitFrequency', 'Like', and other categorical attributes.

## Analysis and Code

The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models), and visualization techniques to understand consumer behavior and segment customers based on their preferences.

The code is organized into Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks, showcasing various data processing, analysis, and visualization steps.

### Key Analysis Steps

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Label encoding categorical variables
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models)
- Visualization (Scatter plots, Mosaic plots, etc.)

## Usage

- **Dataset:** Ensure the `mcdonalds.csv` dataset is placed in the same directory as the code files or specify the correct file path within the code.
- **Dependencies:** The code utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Install missing dependencies using `pip install <library>` if needed.
- **Run the Code:** Execute the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis steps.
